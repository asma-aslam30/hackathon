**Feature**: `002-new-feature-example`
**Created**: December 12, 2025
**Status**: Ready for Implementation
**Author**: SpeckitPlus Assistant

## Phase 1: Specification Creation

### Task 1.1: Create Basic Specification Structure
**Objective**: Set up the basic file structure for the feature specification

#### Acceptance Criteria:
- [ ] Directory `specs/002-new-feature-example/` exists
- [ ] File `spec.md` exists with proper header structure
- [ ] File `plan.md` exists with proper header structure
- [ ] File `tasks.md` exists with proper header structure

#### Test Steps:
1. Verify directory structure exists
2. Check that spec.md follows template format
3. Confirm plan.md includes all required sections
4. Validate tasks.md structure

#### Dependencies: None
#### Priority: P1

### Task 1.2: Define User Stories and Scenarios
**Objective**: Complete the user stories and acceptance scenarios in spec.md

#### Acceptance Criteria:
- [ ] At least 2 user stories defined with priorities
- [ ] Each user story has "Why this priority" explanation
- [ ] Each user story has independent test description
- [ ] All acceptance scenarios follow Given/When/Then format
- [ ] Edge cases section is properly addressed

#### Test Steps:
1. Review user story completeness and clarity
2. Verify Given/When/Then format for scenarios
3. Validate reasonings for priority assignments
4. Check edge cases for completeness

#### Dependencies: Task 1.1
#### Priority: P1

### Task 1.3: Complete Requirements Section
**Objective**: Define comprehensive functional requirements and key entities

#### Acceptance Criteria:
- [ ] Functional requirements numbered FR-001, FR-002, etc.
- [ ] Each requirement includes "MUST", "SHOULD", or "MAY" language
- [ ] Key entities are defined with clear descriptions
- [ ] Requirements map to user stories in spec.md

#### Test Steps:
1. Validate requirement numbering and language
2. Cross-reference requirements with user stories
3. Check key entity descriptions for clarity
4. Verify all requirements are traceable to use cases

#### Dependencies: Task 1.2
#### Priority: P1

## Phase 2: Architecture Planning

### Task 2.1: Complete Architecture Plan
**Objective**: Flesh out the complete architecture plan for the feature

#### Acceptance Criteria:
- [ ] All 8 sections of architecture plan are completed
- [ ] Scope includes clear in/out of scope definitions
- [ ] Key decisions include options, trade-offs, and rationale
- [ ] Non-functional requirements are measurable and realistic
- [ ] Risk analysis includes mitigation strategies

#### Test Steps:
1. Verify all 8 architecture sections exist and are complete
2. Validate scope definitions for completeness
3. Check decision rationales against constitution principles
4. Confirm risk mitigation strategies are actionable

#### Dependencies: Task 1.3
#### Priority: P1

- [ ] Each task has clear acceptance criteria using checkboxes
- [ ] Tasks have appropriate dependencies defined
- [ ] Priority levels (P1, P2, P3) are assigned correctly
- [ ] Test steps are specific and reproducible

#### Test Steps:
1. Review each task for specific actionability
2. Validate acceptance criteria are measurable
3. Verify dependency relationships are logical
4. Confirm priority assignments match importance

#### Dependencies: Task 2.1
#### Priority: P1

### Task 3.2: Validate Constitution Alignment
**Objective**: Ensure the complete specification aligns with constitution principles

#### Acceptance Criteria:
- [ ] AI-First Architecture principle is reflected in spec
- [ ] MCP Integration Standard is addressed appropriately
- [ ] Documentation-First principle is demonstrated
- [ ] All constitution sections are referenced where applicable
- [ ] No contradictions with core principles exist

#### Test Steps:
1. Cross-reference AI-First principle with specification
2. Verify MCP Integration is considered
3. Confirm Documentation-First approach is evident
4. Validate all constitution elements are respected

#### Dependencies: Task 3.1
#### Priority: P1

---

### Task 3.3: Create Success Criteria Metrics
**Objective**: Define measurable outcomes for feature success

#### Acceptance Criteria:
- [ ] At least 4 success criteria defined with SC-XXX numbers
- [ ] Each criterion is measurable with specific percentages/targets
- [ ] Success criteria align with user stories and requirements
- [ ] Metrics can be validated after implementation

#### Test Steps:
1. Verify success criteria numbering and measurability
2. Cross-reference criteria with user stories
3. Validate measurement approaches are realistic
4. Confirm targets are achievable and meaningful

#### Dependencies: Task 3.2
#### Priority: P1
