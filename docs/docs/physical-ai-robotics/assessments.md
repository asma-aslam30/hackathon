# Assessments

## High-level overview
Outline the assessment strategy for the course, including quizzes, assignments, midterm, and the capstone project, ensuring evaluation of both theoretical understanding and practical application.

## Deep technical explanation
*   **Quizzes:** Short, frequent checks on theoretical concepts (ROS 2 commands, VLM principles).
*   **Programming Assignments:** Practical tasks in each module (e.g., ROS 2 node implementation, Isaac Sim environment setup).
*   **Midterm Exam:** Comprehensive assessment of Modules 1-3.
*   **Capstone Project:** The primary assessment, demonstrating holistic understanding and application of all course concepts to build the autonomous humanoid.
*   **Grading Rubrics:** Detailed criteria for each assessment component.

## Real-world examples
How assessments mirror real-world engineering tasks (e.g., debugging ROS 2 systems, training RL agents, integrating components).
