# Weekly Breakdown (Week 1–13)

## High-level overview
A structured timeline for the course, ensuring progressive learning and effective project integration.

## Deep technical explanation
*   **Week 1:** Introduction to Physical AI.
*   **Week 2-3:** Module 1: ROS 2 Fundamentals (`rclpy` nodes, topics, services, actions, TF2).
*   **Week 4-5:** Module 2: Gazebo Simulation (SDF, ROS 2 integration, custom worlds).
*   **Week 6:** Module 2: Unity Simulation (Unity Robotics Hub, ROS-TCP-Connector, URDF import).
*   **Week 7-8:** Module 3: NVIDIA Isaac Sim (USD, Python API, basic robot control).
*   **Week 9:** Module 3: Isaac Gym & Synthetic Data (RL fundamentals, domain randomization).
*   **Week 10:** Module 4: VLM Introduction & Vision for Action (Image captioning, object detection).
*   **Week 11:** Module 4: Language Grounding & Task Planning (Translating commands to actions).
*   **Week 12:** Module 4: Conversational Robotics & Advanced VLA Integration.
*   **Week 13:** Capstone Project Work & Presentations.
