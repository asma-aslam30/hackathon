# Model Context Protocol (MCP) Integration in AI Robotics

Welcome to the comprehensive documentation for Model Context Protocol (MCP) integration in Enhanced AI Robotics systems. This section provides detailed information about how AI robotics systems can leverage standardized protocols to access external tools, services, and documentation.

## About MCP Integration

Model Context Protocol (MCP) serves as the communication backbone for AI robotics systems, enabling standardized interactions between robots and external services. Our implementation provides:

- **Tool Access**: Robots can discover and utilize external tools through MCP servers
- **Context Management**: Dynamic retrieval of environmental and operational context
- **Knowledge Integration**: Access to up-to-date documentation and API specifications
- **Service Coordination**: Coordination between multiple external services and internal robotics systems

## Documentation Sections
