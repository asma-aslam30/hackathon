## Prompt

sp.tasks "Chapter Personalization"

## Response snapshot

Created comprehensive tasks.md file for Chapter Personalization feature with 9 phases of implementation tasks organized by user story priority. The tasks include foundational setup, core personalization engine, preference controls, advanced profile utilization, analytics/feedback, edge case handling, integration/testing, and polish phases. MVP approach focuses on core P1 user story for immediate value delivery.

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: Complete task breakdown for Chapter Personalization implementation
- 🧪 Tests: No tests specified in current scope (would be added in /sp.tasks phase if requested)
- 📁 Files: Created tasks.md with structured implementation tasks
- 🔁 Next prompts: Ready for implementation with /sp.implement or planning with /sp.plan
- 🧠 Reflection: Tasks organized by user story priority with parallel execution opportunities identified

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)

- Failure modes observed: None
- Graders run and results (PASS/FAIL): N/A
- Prompt variant (if applicable): N/A
- Next experiment (smallest change to try): Begin implementation of Phase 1-3 tasks
