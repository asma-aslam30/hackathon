## Prompt

```text
/sp.tasks
```

## Response snapshot

```text
The detailed task breakdown for the "Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics" textbook has been generated and saved to specs/001-physical-ai-robotics/tasks.md. It provides a comprehensive, chapter-by-chapter list of setup, foundational, and core module implementation tasks, organized by user story, including detailed steps for code, simulation, hardware, expected outputs, difficulty, learning outcomes, mini-challenges, and cross-module links. The tasks cover ROS2, Gazebo, Unity, NVIDIA Isaac, and VLA integration, aligned with a 13-week progression.
```

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: The detailed task breakdown for the "Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics" textbook has been generated, outlining chapter-by-chapter implementation tasks, code, simulation, hardware, and learning outcomes.
- 🧪 Tests:
- 📁 Files: `specs/001-physical-ai-robotics/tasks.md`
- 🔁 Next prompts: /sp.implement
- 🧠 Reflection: Successfully generated and wrote the task breakdown based on the specification and plan. PHR creation was interrupted and is now being completed.

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)

- Failure modes observed: Interruption during PHR write.
- Graders run and results (PASS/FAIL):
- Prompt variant (if applicable):
- Next experiment (smallest change to try):
